<!-- debounce works well for filtering while you are typing (only change after you are done typing), validation only happening after a certain amount of time, or preventing accidental double clicks (pressing buy twice). Debounce only invokes after a certain period of time has cleared (if you keep moving mouse event and never stop, debounce will never call) -->

<script>
  const initApp = () => {
    const button = document.querySelector('button')
    button.addEventListener('click', debounce(clickLog, 2000))
  }

  const clickLog = () => {
    console.log('clicked')
  }

  document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', initApp)

  // debounce takes a function and invokes it after some delay
  const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
    let id
    console.log(`id at immediate load ${id}`) // this is only logged at load time (after the event has been added), but the click event now returns the anonymous function below (debounce returns a function)
    return (...args) => { // this is handler
      console.log(`previous id: ${id}`)
      if (id) clearTimeout(id) // if delay is already in progress, clear it and call settimeout again
      // settimeout only executes the function after delay
      id = setTimeout(() => { // settimeout returns an integer value which identifies the timer which can be used to cancel it
        fn(...args)
